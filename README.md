# toy-webstore

This project is made just to practise Java MVC. 
It is not yet done but I am satisfied with what I have done so far, considering that I started learning 
about Java programming a year ago. And I started from zero knowlege about programming.

The project is about online toy store, where you can buy toys made from natural materials. 
I have a corresponging database consisting out of three tables (user, products, selling).
Table selling is a table where every selling is recorded, and it contains only foreign keys.

There are login and register forms, list of all avilable products, form for shipment data, and contact form.

It still has a lot of job to do, and I am working on it.
